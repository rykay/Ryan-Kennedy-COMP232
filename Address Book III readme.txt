To operate my ToDo list, enter the task you’d like to add to the list at the top of the program. To finish entering and have it appear on the list below click enter. You may enter as many tasks as you like. Between two launches of the app, there is no persistence, so your tasks won’t save between different launches. Eventually the program will have persistence, and you’ll be able to delete tasks, search for certain tasks, and update certain tasks. 


To test my app, I launched it on several emulators. I launched it on devices all with different display resolutions to see whether or not it’d crash the app. I tested it on the Pixel 3 (1080 x 2220), the Pixel 4 (1440 x 3040), the Pixel C (2560 x 1800), and the Pixel XL (1440 x 2560). 


I’ve attached screenshots of the tests below.
